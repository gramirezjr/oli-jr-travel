We got engaged!! After moving out of our apartment, Junior and I moved back home with our families. It had been a week since we had seen each other when Junior picked me up in the late morning on Wednesday February 7th. We got in the car and made our way east towards Palm Springs. We drove up to the entrance of the tramway and boarded the next gondola. It was perfect weather on the ground, but as soon as we got high enough on the gondola, the snow on the mountainside was literally two feet deep – it looked like we were going to visit the Grinch! 

It was so cold and windy once we made it to the top. We walked around Mountain Station for a bit before making our way outside. The wind was so strong, it was kicking snow up at us from the hillsides. I forgot my hiking boots at home (even though I had them in my hand minutes before walking out the door!) so I carefully walked down the walkway in my tennis shoes. We made our way to the bottom where families in full snow gear were sledding down the hills. The hiking trails had more compact snow, so we started down one of them. After following behind Junior for about 15 minutes, he stopped us in the middle of the snow where no one else was around. He started his heartwarming speech and I felt like I was going to black out. Before I knew it, he was on one knee asking me to marry him. I said yes of course (I barely had any time to pull the ring out of my pocket before she picked me up for a hug - Junior) and we made our way back to Mountain Station before we froze to death. Coincidentally and ceremoniously the sun started shining with some blue skies and we snapped a few pictures before heading out.

We had a celebratory drink at the bar and then made our way to the restaurant for dinner. We were all smiles at dinner and it was about 7 o’clock when we decided to hop on the next gondola down the mountain. The station employee let us know the next gondola would be departing in 15 minutes. Well, 15 minutes came and went. And then 30 minutes, and then an hour and we were still no closer to getting on a gondola down. They told us that the gondola got stuck because of the very cold weather and that they were able to get it unstuck, but had to perform a few test runs before sending passengers down. We wouldn’t be making our way down the mountain for another 50 minutes. By the time we got back to the valley it would be past 11 o’clock. Definitely a day we will never forget hahaha!
