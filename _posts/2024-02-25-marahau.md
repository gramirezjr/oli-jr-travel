Today our only mission is to get to the small town at the trailhead of the Abel Tasman. We had the nicest driver from Nelson to Marahau and back. She is a local Kiwi and taught us a lot about the region, gave us tips for the trail, and warned us to keep eyes on our stuff because we’d surely encounter the “Marahau Mafia” while on the Abel Tasman. You can read about our encounter in our next blog post, but believe you me, once she said that most tourists walking the trail don’t make it out without having something stolen from them, I was about ready to book the next flight home.

Once we were in Marahau, we checked into another great hostel located right at the trailhead, The Barn. This place was great too, it was really open with an outdoor deck surrounded by the small dorm units. There were campsites, a yoga deck, small soccer goals, and a garden. After walking around the property, we stumbled upon a slackline set up just to the side of the deck. We took our sandals off and each took our turns on it. Neither of us had slacklined in several years so we were definitely rusty. A nice kid walked up to us and joined in on the fun. We'd learn a bit about him, that he was from England and also quit his job. He was working at The Barn in exchange for free accommodation. We'd end up running into him again later on the trail. We also had a really great roommate from Germany who had been in New Zealand for three months already. He was also a mechanical engineer that quit his job back home. He shared stories of where he had been the past three months and where he was headed after New Zealand. So many great conversations with locals and travelers alike!
