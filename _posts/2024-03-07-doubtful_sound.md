Today was probably one of those days that we will never forget, a day that we will probably think back to often whenever we need an extra bit of calm and grounding. We went into the Doubtful Sound today and just getting there was an experience in itself. It can only be accessed by hopping on a boat in Manapouri to cross the lake where you then take a bus across the Wilmot Pass, where you then board your cruise into the sound. Our bus driver was a lovely man who explained some of the unique history of New Zealand. He talked about the region's UNESCO World Heritage status, invasive land animals, and the “Helicopter Wars.” He also pointed out a remote youth hostel and highlighted the importance of environmental education and conservation for the next generation. 

We finally arrived at the dock to board our 3-hour boat cruise into the Doubtful Sound and a few words to sum up our experience would be magical, other-worldly, and very wet. All of Fiordland National Park from the Milford Sound in the north to the Doubtful Sound in the south and every sound in between and beyond, is so incredibly unique, truly unlike anything Junior or I had ever seen before. Back when we were driving to Milford Sound, I told Junior that this had to be the wettest national park I had ever been to (and we’ve been to many national parks between the two of us). He didn’t believe me, but today it was confirmed – Fiordland is one of the wettest places in the world with a mean annual rainfall of 268 inches, and it rains an average of 200 calendar days each year!

It was raining the couple days preceding our tour and the whole duration of our cruise, so this meant that the waterfalls all throughout the sound would be flowing nice and strong! It also meant that we would be soaking wet by the end of our tour hahaha. We enjoyed some snacks on the cruise and listened to our tour guide walk us through the history of navigation in the sounds. He pointed out waterfalls, talked to us about native and invasive species on the islands that make up the sound, and gave us some insight as to how the glaciers that carved these sounds determined so much of the makeup of the environment. The tour was unforgettable and something we’d recommend to anyone truly looking to experience the natural beauty of New Zealand.

The pictures we’re posting can’t even begin to sum up the beauty we witnessed. This corner of the earth felt so raw and untouched.
