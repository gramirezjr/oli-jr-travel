Hello and welcome to Oli & Junior's travel blog! We decided to leave our jobs at the beginning of 2024 to travel the world for a bit. We'll be gone for about 6 months to a year, and decided to create this blog so all our favorite people can follow along on our adventures. From the home page, you can click on each country to see pictures and read posts about what we did in our time there. We also have a [Gallery](https://gramirezjr.github.io/oli-jr-travel/gallery/) of all our photos for you to scroll through.

You can sign up to receive email updates whenever we make a new post by subscribing below:
